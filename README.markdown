Airclash
========

This is a game in the making, which is very much unfinished.

The setting is a 2D world (side view) where you can control different
ground and air units. Your main building (head quarter), which is a
flying fortress, is composed of different separate modules (such
as generators, thrusters, cannons, shield generators, etc.).

This is no playable game at the moment. Features that are implemented:

 * Initializing graphics and displaying a window
 * Keyboard handling
 * In-game console (similar to Quake)
 * Loading a level from an SVG file
 * 2D physics (collision etc.)
 * Scrolling level
 * Moving around with two basic units (1 driving, 1 flying)
 * Beginning of the interface for adding modules to the HQ

Technologies used are: Java, Phys2d, LWJGL, FengGUI, Dom4J.
This is an Eclipse project that uses Checkstyle and PMD.
